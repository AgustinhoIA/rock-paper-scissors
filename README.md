This is a rock paper scissors project to practice basic javascript.

It will be updated as I learn more about how to stylish and write better code.

I will do this project in the following way

Create the basic files
Create the basic structure for the files 
Analyze what I want this program to do 
Write down the algorithm I'm going to follow on JS to get to my solution 
Refine that algorithm 
Write the code based on the algorithm 
Test it
style it
